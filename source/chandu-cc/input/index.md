[F#](https://fsharp.org/) (exploring the language casually) Shader programming (fragment, vertex generating art and computer shaders)  

> Math  

Math-related to develop computer shaders and computer-generated art. Computer science algorithms and data structures ( algorithmic problem solving )  

--------------------------

**Side Projects I am working on**

An angular and .Net project (private repo).  
A Pomodoro timer.  
Reverse engineering software that converts binary into readable code ( experimental and for learning experience )  
Chandu.cc ( with tailwind )  
Bunch of prototypes in my Github.
