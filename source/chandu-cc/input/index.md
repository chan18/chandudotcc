> I mostly do full stack development in my job

I specialize in full-stack development in my current role, but my passion for the computer science and software industry extends to various other technologies. I enjoy blogging, giving talks, and working on side projects related to the following areas:

**Languages**: I have experience with c99, C#, Javascript, Typescript, and SQL.

**Frameworks**: My expertise includes working with .NET Core and Angular.

**Computer Science**: I have a deep interest in Automata Theory, Compiler Design, Operating Systems, Distributed and Cloud Computing, Networking and Security, Computer Architecture, and Computer Graphics.

**Software Development**: My experience spans web application development, open-source development, SDK development, API development, game engine and simulator development, memory hacking, system design, query optimization, and dev tools.

--------------------------

**Currently, I am actively learning the following:**

> Programming Languages

[C# 9](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/welcome-to-c-9-0/)  
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (system programming)  
[F#](https://fsharp.org/) (exploring the language casually) Shader programming (fragment, vertex generating art and computer shaders)  

> Math  

I am studying math related to developing computer shaders and computer-generated art, as well as computer science algorithms and data structures for algorithmic problem-solving.

--------------------------

**Here are some of the side projects I am currently working on:**

- An Angular and .NET project (private repository)
- A Pomodoro timer
- Reverse engineering software that converts binary code into readable code (experimental and for learning purposes)
- Chandu.cc (built with Tailwind CSS)
- Several prototypes on my GitHub
- Chip-8 VM with TypeScript
